# German Credit Scorecard

## Overview

This repository focuses on building a credit scorecard for the German credit dataset. The goal is to evaluate creditworthiness using various attributes and determine the creditability of an individual.

## Dataset

The dataset `GermanCreditData.xlsx` comprises several attributes, both numerical and categorical:

- `Creditability`
- `Account_Balance`
- `Duration_of_Credit_monthly`
- `Payment_Status_of_Previous_Credit`
- `Purpose`
- `Credit_Amount`
- `Value_Savings_Stocks`
- `Length_of_current_employment`
- `Instalment_per_cent`
- `Sex_Marital_Status`
- `Guarantors`
- `Duration_in_Current_address`
- `Most_valuable_available_asset`
- `Age_years`
- `Concurrent_Credits`
- `Type_of_apartment`
- `No_of_Credits_at_this_Bank`
- `Occupation`
- `No_of_dependents`
- `Telephone`
- `Foreign_Worker`

There are 20 attributes in total, with 7 being numerical and 13 categorical. An alternative version of the dataset, `german.numer`, contains 24 numerical attributes.

## Code

The main analysis and scorecard building process can be found in the Jupyter notebook `score-card.ipynb`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (you might need to create a `requirements.txt` or equivalent based on the libraries used in the notebook).
3. Open the `score-card.ipynb` file in a Jupyter notebook environment.
4. Execute the notebook to reproduce the analysis and generate the scorecard.
